### Speciation in the Baikal sculpin radiation
<img style="float: left;" src="/images/cottocomephorus_350x282.png">
The Baikal sculpin radiation is a species flock of more than 30 sculpin species endemic to the Lake Baikal Basin in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia. They have divergend in the last ~2 million years, taking advantage of vacant niches in the worlds deepest lake. Among these species is the benthopelagic genus _Cottocomephorus_, one of only two Sculpin genera to invade the pelagic zone, the other being the Baikal Oilfish, _Comephorus_. Without a swimbaldder, these pelagic sculpins have reduced their skeletons and increased their fat storage to acheive neutral  buoyancy.
The taxonomy of _Cottocomephorus_ was unresolved before I started my research. We found that _Cottocomephorus_ encompasses 3 species which span a gradient from more benthic behavior to more pelagic. Their skull structure also reflects a transistion from feeding on benthic inverebrates to the pelagic Baikal amphipod, _Macrohectopus branickii_. Our finding fits into a larger pattern of fishes speciation over depth gradients.

### Red king crab population genomics

The Alaskan red king crab fishery supports fishing communities from Oregon to western Alaska and is one of the most valuable invertebrate fisheries in the US. After a fishery crash in the 1980s, most populations have rebounded, but the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) fishery remained below fishable abundance. We used low coverage whole genome sequencing to describe population structure, finding three previously undetected populations and evidence of local adaptation in the GOA population. Our findings are being used by managers to inform a stock enhancement effort aimed at building the GOA population back to fishable abundance.

### The saga of the Summer Suckers
#### Species delineation

The Summer Sucker was first described in 1886 as a small, early spawning species sister the White Sucker, and endemic to the Adirondack region of New York State. Since then, it has been redescribed either as a species or subspecies 6 different times, most recently as a species in 2008. Its species status was again questioned based on inconsistent morphological characters and contradictory genetic data. We combined observational field studies with whole genome sequencing in two lakes where Summer Suckers and White Suckers co-occur to disentangle evolutionary relationships and better define diagnostic characters between the two species. 


#### Life history evolution

A consequence of Summer Suckers and White Suckers being synonymized under the same species is that they now represent nearly the largest variability in adult size known in fishes. Adult Summer Suckers may be as much as 100x smaller in mass than adult White Sucker individuals. Building on the phenotype-genotype data used to assess species status, we were able to attribute this size variation to differences in age at 50% maturity (M50). This divergence in M50 was convergently evolved in at least two Summer Sucker-White Sucker populations, involving genes that control M50 in mice and atlantic salmon. Life history variation and the genomic processes underlying that variation may be especially powerful drivers of divergence in fishes.
