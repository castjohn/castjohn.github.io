![cottocomephorus](/images/cottocomephorus "Lake Baikal Sculpin Speciation"){:style="float"}
The Baikal sculpin radiation is a species flock of more than 30 sculpin species endemic to the Lake Baikal Basin in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia. They have divergend in the last ~2 million years, taking advantage of vacant niches in the worlds deepest lake. Among these species is the benthopelagic genus _COttocomephorus_, one of only two Sculpin genera to invade the pelagic zone, the other being the Baikal Oilfish, _Comephorus_. Without swimbaldder, these pelagic sculpins have reduced their skeletons and increased their fat storage to acheive neutral buoyancy.
The taxonomy of _Cottocomephorus_ was unresolved before I started my research. We found that _Cottocomephorus_ encompasses 3 species which span a gradient from more benthic behavior to more pelagic. Their skull structure also reflects a transistion from feeding on benthic inverebrates to the pelagic Baikal amphipod, _Macrohectopus branickii_. Our finding fits into a larger pattern of fishes speciating over depth gradients.
