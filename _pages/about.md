Howdy! You've found my personal website so here's a little bit about myself...

I am an evolutionary biologist that uses a combination of genomic, ecological, and trait data to help resolve conservation and management challenges. Fish and fisheries have been my focus, but I find comparisons across taxa are essential to understanding the larger role of evolutionary processes in conservation. I have studied highly speciose taxa such as Sebastes rockfishes and Lake Baikal Sculpins, and species depauperate taxa like Catastomidae Suckers and Lithodinae King Crabs. 

Good applied research in my field starts with strong collaboration with management agencies and rights holders to establish management-relevant goals. Often, these goals involve delineation of species and conservation units. _If you don't know what's out there, you can't manage it!_ To this end, (and in an impossible effort to balance field and desk work), I have often combined robust field studies that generate rich trait and ecological datasets with genomic methods to unravel cryptic species complexes. This work also uncovers patterns of rapid evolution, local adaptation, and demographic histories that may be used in captive breeding or stock enhancement programs.
